# ‚ùå [DEPRECATED] Version

## This project has been abandonned because of the following reasons:

1. This is an old version of this project, written in JS (Nest.js) and puppeteer, which was quite slow. So I rewrite it entirly in Go: [New Repo](https://github.com/Ilingu/ack_v2/tree/main/APIs/adkami-scrapping-api).
2. This repo has been moved in the mono repo of it [associated project](https://github.com/Ilingu/ack_v2)
